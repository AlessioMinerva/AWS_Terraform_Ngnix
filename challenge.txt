Hi, I'm Alessio Minerva<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --><p> Welcome to my solution! I hope you find the solutions provided up to your standards.</p><!-- qowifjqwoeijfoqweijfqweoifjqweofijqweoqwoijefoqwijefoijfqiwoefjj -->
<p>The page you're currently visiting is hosted on a Nginx server running on the cloud. It was deployed using a Terraform and a Bash script that can be reused to automate the launch of webservers. The Terraform script takes care of the infrastructure by creating a Linux server in AWS with all the necessary requirements. Please check out the Github page for more information.</p><!-- qowifjqwoeijfoqweijfqweoifjqweofijqweoqwoijefoqwijefoijfqiwoefjj -->
<p>The Bash script is straightforward. After booting up, it installs Nginx to enable us to host a website. To make it more exciting than writing "Hello World!" I decided to create a page on Github and copy the content of that page (AKA the page you're viewing now).</p><!-- owlsqweoifjqwoefijqwoeifjqwoefijwef -->
